/* 
soo whats hapenning here?

like if we just used drag="x" without the useMotionValue, it would still work right?
yes, drag will obv work! we'll be able to drag the element in x direction.

so why we added style={{x}} with useMotionValue??
âœ… drag="x" alone = makes the box move visually (Framer Motion handles transform internally).
âœ… style={{ x }} = connects that motion value (x) to the actual movement, so you can read, react to, or control it yourself.

ðŸ§© Think of it like this analogy:

drag="x" = automatic car â€” moves fine, but you canâ€™t see or tweak the engine.
style={{ x }} = manual + dashboard access â€” you can read, tune, and control the engine.

// now here..  what exactly is useMotionValue doing differently than just using useState? is it just more optimized for motion values?
// or is there some other benefit?.. the ans is that useMotionValue is specifically designed for handling values that will be animated or changed frequently, providing better performance and smoother animations compared to useState.
export default StyleUseMotion
